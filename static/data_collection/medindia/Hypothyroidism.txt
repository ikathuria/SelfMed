Postpartum thyroiditis is one of the most common causes of hypothyroidism affecting 10% of women
History of hypothyroidism in the family is a more likely risk factor for developing the disease. Sometimes a tumor in the pituitary gland could stop the production of thyroid hormones. Radiation therapy may also affect thyroid gland function and cause hypothyroidism. Radiation induced thyroid dysfuction affecting nearly 20 to 30% patients administered curative radiotherapy to the neck region (3✔

Soy products and soybeans contain goitrogenic compounds that interfere with thyroid hormone levels in the body and make it worse for a person with hypothyroidism. Soy reduces thyroid production and may aggravate the symptoms of hypothyroidism and cause a higher deficiency in levels of thyroid hormones (5✔



).
Essential Oils, Natural Oils and Fatty Acids: Essential oils and fatty acids are important in keeping the thyroid gland healthy. Fish oils are good source of omega 3 fatty acids, which promotes thyroid hormone production. They boost body immunity and reduce inflammation, which may be an underlying cause of lowered thyroid activity (6✔



). Natural fats in avocado, nuts, flaxseeds, fish, walnuts and animal products maintain a hormonal balance in the body. Coconut oil also provides energy and boosts immunity. Taking a regular dose of coconut oil or using it as the cooking medium will add the beneficial fatty acids to the diet that improve thyroid function.

Nuts, green vegetables, eggs, meat and legumes are rich in protein that may help combat the symptoms of hypothyroidism (9✔



).
Go for Natural Iodine: Iodine is needed for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland. Adding the right amount of iodine helps maintain the thyroid hormone levels in the body. Reduced thyroid gland activity might be due to low iodine in diet or due to greater than required iodine content. It is best to eat foods that are naturally rich in iodine like seafood and seaweeds. Kelp is a good choice to replenish the lost iodine in the body. Avoid artificial iodine supplementation as they may increase the iodine levels than required and hamper thyroid production (10✔
