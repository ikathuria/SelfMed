What is Cough?
A cough is a reaction to clear the airways of mucus, phlegm, dust, smoke or a foreign body. Whenever there is an obstruction or inflammation in the throat or in the upper airways, the brain thinks it to be a foreign object and tries to relieve it by coughing. Continuous coughing for more than two weeks needs medical attention.
