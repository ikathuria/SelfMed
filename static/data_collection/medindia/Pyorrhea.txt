What is Pyorrhea?
Pyorrhea is a condition characterized by bleeding gums. Pyorrhea is the cause of an attack of a bacillus upon the gums and teeth. The bacillus thrives and multiplies on the deposits of food that gets accumulated within the gaps of the teeth. The accumulation leads to lack of proper exercise of the gums, which lowers the resistance of the gums. Good oral hygiene, proper brushing of teeth, flossing and scaling are effective ways to prevent pyorrhea.
