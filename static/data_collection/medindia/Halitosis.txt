What is Halitosis?
Halitosis, a common problem among dental patients, is an unpleasant odor emanating from the oral cavity. The main origin of all bad breath odors emanate from the mouth itself, although non-oral parts such as the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the gastrointestinal tract, and some diseases involving the kidneys or the liver may also be the reason for it.
