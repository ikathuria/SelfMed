What is Acne?
Acne is a skin condition in which red, inflamed pimples and non-inflamed pimples appear on the skin. Hormones cause the oil glands of the skin to enlarge and produce clogging of the gland and the hair follicle to which it is attached. These pimples usually appear on the face, but are sometimes also found on the chest and neck. In most cases, acne goes away without leaving any scars.
