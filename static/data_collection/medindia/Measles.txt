What is Measles?
Measles is a highly communicable viral disease marked by grains of sand like symptoms appearing in the cheeks and proceeding to trunk, palms and soles lasting for about 5 days. Measles is mainly a respiratory infection, even though outward symptoms indicate its presence. Vaccination is the best mode that provides immunity against measles. Once infected it gives lifelong immunity. Vitamin A supplementation during measles significantly reduces risks of morbidity and mortality.
