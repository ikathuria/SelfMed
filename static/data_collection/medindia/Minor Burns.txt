What are Minor Burns?
Minor burns are burns that affect only the top layer of the skin, and are also called as the first degree burns. Minor burns are caused by steam, electricity, chemicals, radiation or any other kind of heat. Most minor burns will heal on their own, especially when natural home remedies are used, but if left untreated minor burns can develop painful blisters. In case the burn injury is more severe, you should visit a doctor for medical attention.
