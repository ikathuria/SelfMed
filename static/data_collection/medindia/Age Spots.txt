Age spots can be reduced by using bleaching agents and cosmetic products, but it is always better to prevent them by reducing sun exposure or using sunscreens before stepping out in the sun.
There are many permanent age spot treatments offered by skin clinics these days and various age spot creams are available in the market.
Causes of Age Spots
Wondering why are you getting such discolorations all over your face and neck? The answer lies in the upper layer of skin, which contains melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. Overexposure of skin to sun rays causes increased production of melanin to protect the inner layers of skin from harmful UV rays. Clustered melanin particles generate skin tan that eventually develops into age spots.
Prolonged use of electronic tanning lamps and tanning beds can also cause skin darkening. Aging, chronic illness and poor nutrition are also contributing factors for age spots.
