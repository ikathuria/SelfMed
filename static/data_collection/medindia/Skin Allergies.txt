What are Skin Allergies?
Skin allergies are one of the most common medical conditions. Skin allergies occur when a person’s immune system overreacts to a particular substance, that is harmless to most people. The substances which cause such reaction are called allergens and the response of the skin to an allergen is known as Allergic Skin Reaction. This reaction is due to certain antibodies IgE, which are produced by the body in response to the allergen. The common signs of skin allergies include dryness, flaking, redness, itchiness, rash and swelling. There may also be itchy raised bumps, which look like ant bites. The allergic skin conditions include Eczema [Atopic Dermatitis], Contact Dermatitis, Hives [Urticaria] and Angioedema.
