What is Low Blood Pressure?
Low blood pressure (hypotension) is the pressure of the blood in the arteries. It occurs when the pressure of the blood is abnormally low. Blood pressure is typically recorded as the systolic pressure (as the heart beats) over the diastolic pressure (time between two beats). A consistent blood pressure reading of 90/60 mm Hg or lower is considered low blood pressure. People with low BP may experience symptoms of dizziness or syncope (fainting) as the blood flow to the brain and other vital organs becomes insufficient.
