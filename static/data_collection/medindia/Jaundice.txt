Common Causes of Jaundice
The red blood cells after a period of 4 months time becomes fragile and become a yellow-colored chemical called Bilirubin. The body usually removes bilirubin from the bloodstream by passing it through the liver and to the kidneys for disposal. The liver, which plays a vital role in removing the bilirubin from the body, may not be able to do so for some reasons, where the bilirubin gets accumulated and causes jaundice.
