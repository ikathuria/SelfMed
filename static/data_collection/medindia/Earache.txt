What is Earache?
Earache is the result of an infection in the ear area. The middle of the ear is normally filled with air. But during a cold, fluid or mucus gets accumulated in the middle ear and may get infected by bacteria, which leads to ear pain. Even infections that affect the ear nerves can be a cause for earache. Longer exposure to loud sound may cause a buzzing or whistling noise in the ear, which leads to a temporary threshold shift, which you are likely to notice as dullness in hearing, usually reversible in a day or two. There are quite a number of reasons for the earache to occur, and all the symptoms require prompt medical care.
