Turmeric helps reduce inflammation in many skin conditions. Curcumin found in turmeric acts as an antioxidant, which helps protect the skin from infections and reduces the healing time for wounds. Add 1 tbsp turmeric powder to 1 tbsp of bitter neem leaves. Grind to paste and apply.
Tip 4:
Tea tree oil can help treat a variety of skin conditions due to its anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and nourishing properties. However, essential oils need to be diluted before using them on the skin.

Bathing plays an important role in eczema treatment, as it helps moisturize the skin. National Eczema Association (NEA) recommends adults to bathe at least once a day using lukewarm water for 10â€“15 minutes. Gentle cleansers should be used instead of soaps and scrubbing the skin needs to be avoided. After bathing, apply an oil-based moisturizer within 3 minutes and gently pat the skin dry to prevent eczema.
