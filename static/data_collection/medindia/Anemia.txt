Anemia is a disorder, which results from a decrease in the concentration of red blood cells or hemoglobin. One of the main functions of hemoglobin is to carry oxygen to tissues and anemia results in the decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Symptoms associated with anemia are dizziness and unconsciousness. People with acute anemia feel tired and look pale.
