What is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a disorder characterized by excess amount of blood glucose or blood sugar. This occurs due to lack of the hormone insulin in the body or because the insulin that is present in the body is not absorbed by the body. There are two types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes called insulin dependent diabetes that usually affects children and teenagers and Type 2 that was previously called non-insulin dependent diabetes and usually affects adults. If left untreated, high glucose levels can damage blood vessels, posing great health problems in the long run (1✔
