What is Malaria?
Malaria is one of the most serious diseases passed on to humans by mosquitoes. It is prevalent in many parts of the world. Anopheles mosquitoes are responsible for spreading malaria to human beings, who is the sole victim of the parasite. One of the most disturbing factors about it is that resistance of the malaria parasite to anti-malarial drugs is increasing and becoming more widespread. These mosquitoes thrive only in tropical climate and cannot survive in cold areas.
