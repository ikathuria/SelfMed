What are Age Spots?
Age spots, also known as solar lentigines and liver spots are painless, flat, dark brown or black blemishes on the skin. They mostly appear on the face, back of the hands, neck, shoulders and sometimes on back and feet due to sun exposure. Age spots commonly occur in older adults more than 50 years of age, but an early appearance of these dark spots are associated with greater exposure to the UV rays of the sun.

Age spots are harmless, lesion-free spots occurring in varied sizes. They do not need any medical treatment and people sometimes misunderstand them as cancerous growths. Age spots can be reduced by using bleaching agents and cosmetic products, but it is always better to prevent them by reducing sun exposure or using sunscreens before stepping out in the sun.
There are many permanent age spot treatments offered by skin clinics these days and various age spot creams are available in the market.
Causes of Age Spots
Wondering why are you getting such discolorations all over your face and neck? The answer lies in the upper layer of skin, which contains melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. Overexposure of skin to sun rays causes increased production of melanin to protect the inner layers of skin from harmful UV rays. Clustered melanin particles generate skin tan that eventually develops into age spots.
Prolonged use of electronic tanning lamps and tanning beds can also cause skin darkening. Aging, chronic illness and poor nutrition are also contributing factors for age spots.
Home Remedies for Age Spots
It is a strenuous task to remove age spots completely, but various creams and permanent age spot treatments are available in the market today. Clinical treatments such as laser age spot removal and other cosmetics are effective but may cause side effects. There are some really effective natural remedies that can be easily followed at home to get rid of age spots. Some of them are:
1. Lemon Juice: Lemon juice is one of the best remedies to reduce age spots.
