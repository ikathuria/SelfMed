What is Asthma?
Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by a decreased ability to breathe easily. The flow of air in and out of the lungs is obstructed in the airways that carry air to the air sacs deep inside the lungs. The larger airways (bronchi), branches into smaller airways (bronchioles), which may be obstructed by tightening of muscles, irritation or swelling in the airways, and accumulation of mucous, thereby resulting in asthma. Asthma can either be acute or chronic. Symptoms associated with asthma are coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.

Home Remedies for Asthma
Tip 1:
Mix 1 tsp of honey with ½ tsp of cinnamon powder. Consume the mixture just before sleeping to treat asthma.
Tip 2:
Boil 8-10 cloves of garlic in ½ cup of milk. Have it at night, as it is good for the early stages of asthma.

Figs are good for draining phlegm. Wash 3-4 dry figs with water. Soak in 1 cup of water. Eat these on an empty stomach and drink the water that the figs were soaked in also. Do not eat anything else for an hour at least. Do this for 2 months.
