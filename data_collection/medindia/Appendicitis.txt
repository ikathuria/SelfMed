Appendicitis can affect anyone, but it often occurs in people between the ages of 10 to 30 years. The common causes of appendicitis is due to the blockage that occur somewhere along the appendix. This may be due to some hard stools that have got trapped in the appendix which makes the bacteria in the trapped stool infected the appendix. Appendicitis is caused by food waste or a hard piece of stool that can block the opening of the cavity running the length of the appendix. Appendicitis may also occur after an infection such as a gastrointestinal viral infection, or it may result from other types of inflammation.
